# Logging in With a Popup

Thanks to a great community contribution, this library also supports logging the user in via a popup. For this, you need to do two things:

- Use ``initLoginFlowInPopup`` instead of ``initLoginFlow``.
- Create and configure a ``silent-refresh.html`` as described [here](./silent-refresh.html) *.

\* Please note this does not mean that you have to use silent refresh too.
